# 65-Percent-Keyboard
QMK Based Keyboard based on the ATmega32A and the VUSB protocol. This build implements an ANSI 65% layout for standard MX-style switches. The ATmega32A is implemented over the more standard ATmega32u4 that has native USB support due to budget constraints and part availability.
